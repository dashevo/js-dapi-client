# [0.14.0](https://github.com/dashevo/dapi-client/compare/v0.13.6...v0.14.0) (2020-07-23)

We completely rewrote DAPI Client to improve code quality, usability, and testability.

In the new version, you can specify not just seeds to connect but also specific DAPI addresses
and even inject own logic to obtain/select nodes. API methods accept the same options
as the `DAPIClient` constructor so you can specify different behavior for each API call.

Previously, faulty nodes were excluded for a specific API call. Now they are banning
for a period of time, and this time increments exponentially in the event of repeated faults.
